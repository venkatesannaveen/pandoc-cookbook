              Continually mix with a very small amount of water in a bowl until a consistency similar to egg whites is achieved.
              Add more water if the mixture is too dry.

      substitutions:
        list:
          - name: Rice flour
    - name: Water
      amount: 1 \sfrac{1}{2}
      unit: cup
      substitutions:
        list:
          - name: Dashi
            notes: >
              For more flavour, use a _dashi_ instead of water.
              This will require more prep time, as a dashi is made by soaking shiitake musrooms and/or konbu (kelp) with warm water for approx. 4 hours.
    - name: Green Cabbage
      amount: \sfrac{1}{4}
      unit: ea.
      notes: >
        Green, nappa, or savoy cabbage is fine.
        Do **not** attempt to substitute with red cabbage---the result is unsightly.
    - name: White or Spanish Onion
      amount: \sfrac{1}{2}
      unit: ea.
    - name: Carrot
      amount: 1
      unit: ea.

      processing: for garnish

  prep:
    - step: >
        In a large bowl, combine flour, eggs, and water.
        Whisk until a smooth, thin batter has formed.
        Mix in chilli flakes, pepper, and sea salt, then set aside.
    - step: Finely chop cabbage add it to batter.
      notes: For a more uniform texture, consider grating the cabbage.
    - step: >
        Finely chop the green onions.
        Add the white/light green portions of the onion to the batter, and set aside the prettier dark green portions.
    - step: Finely chop the half onion and add it to the batter.
    - step: Fold the batter over itself using a spatula (or mix with your hands) until the cabbage and other add-ins are evenly coated.
      notes: The batter can hold in the fridge for a couple days, but may separate and require re-mixing.

  method:
    - step: A small non-stick frying pan, toast black seasame seeds on low heat for 2--5 minutes, then set aside.
    - step: Add oil to the pan and turn the temperature up to medium heat.
    - step: >
        Slowly add the battered cabbage mixture to the pan.
        Using a silicon spatula, pat down the mixture and clean up the sides to form a pancake.
    - step: Cook for approximately 5--10 minutes on each side, then transfer to a cutting board.
    - step: >
        Smother the okonomiyaki with the sauce, and pipe Japanese mayonnaise onto the pancake in a chevron (back-and-forth) pattern.
        Use a chopstick or butter knife to draw parallel lines through the sauces to create a nice visual effect.
        Top the okonomiyaki with the set-aside green onions, and sesame seeds.
        Optinally add bonito for a fun and fishy topping that _dances_ atop the sauces.
  notes: |
    In Japanese, _okonomi_ means "your choice" while _yaki_ means "fried".
    While not strictly necessary, this is usually a cabbage pancake.
    Okonomiyaki is a popular street food in Osaka and can be prepared with a variety of ingredients and toppings.
    In Hiroshima, okonomiyaki are made by layering ingredients rather than mixing them directly into the batter.

    This recipe is vegetarian, but can be made vegan.
    For meat-lovers, it is tasty on top of a weave of bacon or slices of pork belly.
