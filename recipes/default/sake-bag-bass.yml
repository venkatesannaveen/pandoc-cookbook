  prep:
    - step: Tear two 35 cm $\times$ 45 cm pieces of foil and place a fillet in the center of each.
      notes: Parchment paper is traditionally used for this method of cooking, but it is significantly more difficult to work with.
    - step: Coat each fillet with \sfrac{1}{2} tsp. sesame oil.
    - step: >
        Mince ginger and smash the garlic cloves.
        Slice the scallions thinly.
    - step:
        Add a smashed garlic clove, half the ginger and half the green onions to each foil boat.
      notes: If planning to serve in parchment, considering adding a green vegetable like baby bok choy or mustard greens to the pouch.
    - step: Fold three sides of the foil up like an envelope, crimping the edges to create a seal.
    - step: Through the open side of the envelope, add a splash of sake with half the soy sauce to each boat.
    - step: >
        Fold up the remaining side of the foil and crimp to form a tightly sealed foil pocket.
        Carefully transfer to a baking tray.

  method:
    - step: Heat the oven to 400\textdegree F.
    - step: Meanwhile, heat a small pan over medium heat and toast the seasame seeds for 1--2 minutes.
    - step: Bake the fish for 15--20 minutes, until the fish is opaque and cooked through.
    - step: Serve directly in the foil, or pierce the bag to release the steam and carefully transfer to a plate.
      notes: >
        Foil isn't the prettiest to serve, but parchment can look nice on a plate when sliced open with a sharp knife.
        Slicing the pouch at the table will allow guests to enjoy the aromas as they are released.
    - step: Sprinkle with black seasame seeds as a garnish.
  notes: |
    This steamed bass is infused with umami flavours and cooked with the French _en papillote_ technique.
    Quite simply, cooking the fish in a bag allows you to seal in the flavours while steaming the fish.

    Serve this over or alongside a bed of steamed jasmine or black rice, or with roasted sweet potato or carrots.
