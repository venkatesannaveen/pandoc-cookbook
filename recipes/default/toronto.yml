        Fernet is a style of _amaro_ bitter orginating from Italy.
        It is flowery, medicinal, and has a bold peppermint flavour.

      substitutions:
        list:
          - name: Orange liqueur (any)
            notes: Rather than using simple syrup, I enjoy Triple Sec, for a less sweet/syrup-y mouthfeel, and fruitier orange notes.
    - name: Angostura bitters
      amount: 2
      unit: dash
    - name: Orange peel
    - name: Ice
      processing: cracked; large cubes
  method:
    - step: In a cocktail shaker, combine rye, Fernet-Branca, syrup, and bitters.
    - step: Stir with ice for 20 seconds (don't shake).
    - step: >
        Strain into a whisky tumbler with large ice cubes.
        Alternatively, serve in a chilled coup glass with no ice.
    - step: Squeeze and twist an orange peel over the glass and drop as a garnish.
  notes: |
    A dry, mildly bitter variation on the _Old Fashioned_, distinguished by the addition of Fernet-Branca.
    Sugar cuts the somewhat medicinal profile of the Fernet-Branca, and the rye whisky complements its bitterness for a sophistated overall drink.
