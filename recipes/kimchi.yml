      notes: 1 cup of salt per 1000g of napa cabbage

  method:
    - step: Remove all the outside green leaves from the napa cabbage.
    - step: Cut the napa cabbage in half lengthwise - only cut through the bottom stem and separate by hand.
    - step: Separate each half into quarters (same method as previous step).
    - step: Remove the root end with a knife and cut each quarter of the napa cabbage into bite-sized pieces.
    - step: Wash the cut napa cabbage pieces - pay particular attention to removing any soil.
    - step: >
            In a large bowl, add one layer of napa cabbage, followed by a layer of kimchi salt.
            Repeat this layer-by-layer until you have salted all of the cut napa cabbage.
      notes: The white part of the napa cabbage salts slower than the leaves so make sure you have properly salted these areas.
    - step: Mix some salt into a few tbsp of warm water and dissolve - drip over the bowl of salted napa cabbage.
    - step: Mix 1 cup of water with the flour in a saucepan without heat until smooth.
    - step: Turn on the stove to medium and keep stirring until it forms a thick slurry.
    - step: Turn off the heat and keep stirring until the mixture is cooled.
    - step: >
            In a blender, first blend the onion with a little bit of water until it forms a smooth paste.
            Add in the garlic, ginger, and chilis and blend until the mixture is still slightly chunky, but not totally smooth.
    - step: Put the cooled flour slurry from earlier into a bowl.
    - step: Add the mild gochugaru and stir into the slurry.
    - step: Add the mixture from the blender and stir to combine.
    - step: Add the sugar in a bit at a time and stir to combine.
    - step: Optional - add spicy gochugaru to adjust the heat level.
    - step: After 1 hour, flip the salted napa cabbage in the bowl to more evenly distribute the salt.
    - step: Chop the green onion and chives into a small pieces (about \sfrac{1}{2}\" pieces).
    - step: Rinse all the salt off of the napa cabbage - you can taste both the white parts and leaves to make sure of the salt level.
    - step: Toss the rinsed napa cabbage with the green onions, chives, and spicy flour slurry and gently fold together with gloves.
    - step: Pack the tossed kimchi into a glass container and let it ferment at room temperature for a few days before moving to the refridgerator.
